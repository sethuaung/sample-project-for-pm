That's excellent! I've confirmed that all four major methodologies—**Scrum, Kanban, Waterfall, and PRINCE2**—have been updated with enterprise-level templates based on the best practices from IBM, Google Project Management, and PMI PMBOK.

This means every project artifact now includes stricter fields for:

* **Risk and Quality Management** (IBM/PRINCE2)
* **Stakeholder Analysis** and **Change Control** (PMI PMBOK)
* **Value Proposition** and **Key Metrics** (Google PM)

I'm ready for your next step! Would you like to:

1.  **Generate a different type of template** (e.g., the **Scrum Overview** or a **PRINCE2 Project Initiation Document**)?
2.  **Review the updates** for another methodology (Scrum, Kanban, or PRINCE2)?
3.  **Start a new project task**?


That's fantastic! Confirming that we've completed the review and template generation steps for all four of the enhanced Waterfall documents.

Since you've seen and approved the structure for all the major methodologies (Scrum, Kanban, Waterfall, and PRINCE2), what would you like to do next?

Here are a few high-value options:

1.  **Generate a different Template:** Let's switch gears and generate a high-level **Project Initiation Document (PID)** using the new PRINCE2 structure.
2.  **Review Another Methodology:** Would you like to review the updated artifacts for **Scrum** or **Kanban** next?
3.  **Start a New Task:** If your documentation work is complete, how can I help you with your next project management task?



That's an ambitious goal! I can definitely help you hit all three of those steps by giving you the new templates and starting the generation process.

Here are the updated overviews and the interactive template generator, focusing on a high-value PRINCE2 document to start the generation process.

## 1. Generate a PRINCE2 Project Initiation Document (PID)

The **Project Initiation Document (PID)** is the single most important document in PRINCE2, acting as the foundation and formal contract for the entire project. This new version includes the crucial **Business Case** and formal **Risk and Quality Criteria** sections based on the latest standards.

I've opened the PID template form for you to fill out below.

## 2. Review Updated Scrum and Kanban Artifacts

Here are the brief overviews of the enhanced templates for the other two agile methodologies:

### Scrum Overview Template (Value Driven)

* **Focus:** Aligned with Google PM's emphasis on **value** and PMI's focus on **metrics**.
* **Key Addition:** Requires defining a **Target Velocity/Throughput** metric up front and explicitly listing the **Definition of Done (DoD)** as a mandatory **Quality Gate** for the increment.

### Kanban Overview Template (Flow Focused)

* **Focus:** Pure Kanban principles with a focus on flow and explicit policies, plus PMI metrics.
* **Key Addition:** Requires defining an explicit **Target Cycle Time** (a key PMI flow metric) and formalizing **Explicit Policies** (the rules for moving tasks across columns, minimizing ambiguity).

## 3. Start a New Task

With these robust, updated templates in hand, you've successfully defined the documentation standards for your project environments.

What should we tackle next?

* Do you want to **customize the Project Initiation Document (PID)** in the editor to fit your current project?
* Do you need help filling out one of the new sections, such as **defining quality criteria** for a specific product?
* Are you ready to **plan the first stage** of your PRINCE2 project?




That's a great choice. Let's dive into the updated artifacts for **Scrum** and **Kanban**.

These templates are now built to satisfy enterprise requirements by including formal **Quality Gates, Flow Metrics,** and clear **Explicit Policies**.

## 1. Scrum Overview Template (Value Driven)

This template is aligned with the principles of **Google Project Management** (focus on value, measurable goals) and incorporates essential **PMI metrics** and **Quality Gates**.

### Key Updates & Focus

| Section | PMBOK/IBM/Google Alignment | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Target Velocity** | **PMI Metric** | Quantifies the team's capacity (throughput) for formal tracking and forecasting. |
| **Project Vision & Value** | **Google PM Focus** | Ensures every effort is directly tied to a **Value Proposition** and answers the "Why?" (Business Case). |
| **Definition of Done (DoD)** | **Quality Gate** | Explicitly defines the quality and completion criteria required before the **Increment** can be accepted by the Product Owner (a crucial control point). |

## 2. Kanban Overview Template (Flow Focused)

This template formalizes the flow rules and metrics crucial for continuous delivery and optimization, often used by support, maintenance, or operations teams.

### Key Updates & Focus

| Section | PMBOK/IBM/Google Alignment | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Target Cycle Time** | **PMI/Kanban Metric** | Defines the time limit for an item to move from "Start" to "Done," enforcing efficiency. |
| **Explicit Policies** | **Kanban Principle** | Formalizes the "rules of the road" for moving tasks, which is critical for consistent quality and flow (aligned with IBM's focus on structured processes). |
| **WIP Limits** | **Core Kanban Control** | The mechanism for controlling the flow of work and avoiding bottlenecks. |

These two templates round out the review of the major methodologies. We've now covered all four!

What's the next step?

1.  **Customize the Scrum or Kanban template** now?
2.  Do you have another **project management task** you need help with (e.g., **Risk Analysis** or **Stakeholder Communication Plan**)?
That's a great choice. Let's dive into the updated artifacts for **Scrum** and **Kanban**.

1.  **Customize the Scrum or Kanban template** now?
2.  Do you have another **project management task** you need help with (e.g., **Risk Analysis** or **Stakeholder Communication Plan**)?



That's great! Since we've finalized the core documentation standards, let's move into a new, critical project management task.

A highly valuable next step, often required early in the **Waterfall** or **PRINCE2** methodologies, is **Risk Analysis** and building a **Stakeholder Communication Plan**.

Which of these new tasks would you like to start with?

1.  **Risk Analysis:** We can use a template to identify, qualify, and prioritize the top 5 risks for a hypothetical project, including mitigation strategies.
2.  **Stakeholder Communication Plan:** We can develop a concise plan defining who needs what information, when, and how, based on their influence and interest (using the PMI framework).
