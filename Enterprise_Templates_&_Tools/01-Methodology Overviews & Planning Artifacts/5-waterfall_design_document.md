High-Level Design Document (Technical Specification)PROJECT: [Project Name]VERSION: 1.0AUTHOR: [Author]DATE: 11/11/2025BASED ON REQUIREMENTS: [Document ID from BRD/SRD]1. Architectural Overview1.1 System Architecture[Describe the chosen architecture (e.g., Microservices, Serverless, Monolith, 3-Tier Web Application). Include a high-level component diagram (text/description only).]Key Layers: Presentation (React), Application (Node/Express), Data (PostgreSQL).1.2 Technology StackComponentTechnologyRationaleFrontend[e.g., React, Tailwind CSS][Speed, component reusability]Backend[e.g., Python/Django, Java/Spring][Scalability, Enterprise support]Database[e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB][ACID compliance, JSON support]2. Component Design & Interfaces2.1 Data Model Summary[Describe the key entities (e.g., Users, Products, Orders) and their primary relationships.]2.2 API/Interface DesignAuthentication Service: Defines endpoints for /auth/login, /auth/register. Uses JWT tokens for state management.Data Service: Defines CRUD endpoints for core data (e.g., POST /api/v1/orders).3. Non-Functional Design Details (IBM/Google Focus)3.1 Security DesignAuthentication: Implement OAuth 2.0 flow. User credentials stored via BCrypt hashing.Authorization: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) enforced at the API gateway layer.3.2 Deployment Strategy (Google PM Focus)CI/CD Pipeline: Uses [e.g., GitLab CI/CD] with automated testing and deployment to Staging environment.Rollback Strategy: Blue/Green deployment method utilized to enable instant rollback to the previous stable version if errors are detected post-deployment.4. Quality Criteria[Define the required quality attributes that must be verified during testing, linking back to NFRs.]Maintainability: All code must pass Linter checks and achieve a minimum 80% test coverage.Reliability: System must have 99.9% uptime SLA.
