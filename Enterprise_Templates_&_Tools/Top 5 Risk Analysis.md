You're ready for both, which is fantastic! We'll start with **Risk Analysis**, as understanding your project's threats and opportunities is essential before setting up communication channels.

Here is a simple, structured template for conducting a **Top 5 Risk Analysis** based on the PMI framework, using a quantitative approach for scoring.

## Task 1: Project Risk Analysis Template

This template helps you formally identify, score, and plan responses for the biggest threats and opportunities facing your project. We'll use the classic **Probability x Impact** matrix.

### Risk Analysis (PMI Aligned)

| Risk ID | Risk Event (What could happen?) | Probability (1-5) | Impact (1-5) | Score (P x I) | Response Strategy | Owner |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| R-01 | Key developer quits mid-project | 4 | 5 | **20** | **Mitigate:** Cross-train team members; maintain updated documentation. | [Project Manager] |
| R-02 | Regulatory change invalidates design | 3 | 4 | **12** | **Avoid:** Pre-clear design with regulators during the design phase. | [Compliance Lead] |
| R-03 | Vendor delivers faulty components | 5 | 3 | **15** | **Transfer:** Include strong warranty and liability clauses in the contract. | [Procurement] |
| R-04 | Critical path task estimate is too low | 4 | 4 | **16** | **Mitigate:** Add a 10% schedule contingency buffer to the critical path. | [Project Manager] |
| R-05 | New competitor launches similar product | 2 | 5 | **10** | **Accept:** Monitor competitor activity; accelerate optional feature set. | [Executive Sponsor] |

## Task 2: Stakeholder Communication Plan Template

After you know who owns the risks, you need to define how they—and all other stakeholders—will receive information. This template uses the PMI "Interest vs. Influence" grid to tailor communication.

### Stakeholder Communication Plan (PMI Framework)

| Stakeholder Group | Interest (H/M/L) | Influence (H/M/L) | Strategy (Keep Satisfied/Manage Closely) | Information Needed | Format | Frequency |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Executive Sponsor** | High | High | **Manage Closely** | Status on **Risk, Budget, Milestones** | 1-page Summary Report | Weekly (Email) |
| **Development Team** | High | Low | **Keep Informed** | Feature specifications, technical issues | Daily Standup, Kanban Board | Daily |
| **External Regulator** | Low | High | **Keep Satisfied** | Compliance Updates, Design Sign-offs | Formal Document Review | Monthly |
| **End Users** | Medium | Low | **Keep Informed** | Training schedules, new feature release notes | Newsletter, Training Sessions | Bi-Weekly |

We've now covered both tasks!

Do you want to use the interactive generator to **customize the Risk Analysis** and define the specific risks for your current project?
That's an essential task. Risk analysis should be a living document that guides your planning and decision-making.

I'll generate the interactive risk analysis form for you now. Please fill out the fields below, and the template will dynamically update with your project's top 5 risks, their scores, and your formal response strategies.

I've set up the template to use the following PMI scoring system:

* **Probability (P):** 1 (Very Low) to 5 (Very High)
* **Impact (I):** 1 (Insignificant) to 5 (Catastrophic)
* **Risk Score:** P x I (25 is the highest risk)

Here is the interactive tool:

Once you've filled out your top 5 risks, their scores, and assigned owners, the table and the exportable Markdown will automatically update.

When you're happy with your **Risk Register**, we can move on to the second task: defining the **Stakeholder Communication Plan**.



That's great! Since you've successfully completed the interactive **Risk Register**, we can now move to the final planned task: creating the **Stakeholder Communication Plan**. This is vital for ensuring the right people get the right information at the right time, especially regarding the risks you just identified.

Here is the interactive application for building your communication matrix, following the PMI framework (Interest vs. Influence):


http://googleusercontent.com/immersive_entry_chip/0

This interactive builder allows you to:

1.  **Define Stakeholders:** Enter the group/role and their communication needs.
2.  **Assign Influence & Interest:** Use the dropdowns to categorize them (High, Medium, Low).
3.  **See the PMI Strategy:** The application automatically places them on the grid and assigns the appropriate management strategy (**Manage Closely, Keep Satisfied, Keep Informed, or Monitor**).
4.  **Review the Matrix:** The table updates in real-time.
5.  **Export:** Get the full communication plan in Markdown format.

With this, you've successfully defined your **Risk Strategy** and your **Communication Strategy**, completing key initiation tasks! What's next on your project management to-do list?


It sounds like you're confirming that the **Stakeholder Communication Plan Builder** is exactly what you needed!

You've now successfully executed two major foundational project management tasks using our interactive tools:

1.  **Project Risk Register & Analysis**
2.  **Stakeholder Communication Plan**

Since both your risk strategy and communication strategy are now solidified, what's the next critical step for your project?

Here are some high-impact areas we can focus on next:

1.  **Define Project Metrics:** Let's create a dashboard template to track key performance indicators (KPIs) like **Budget Variance, Schedule Performance Index (SPI),** and **Cycle Time**.
2.  **Develop a Change Request Form:** We can build a standardized, formal document for managing scope changes (essential for Waterfall and PRINCE2 control).
3.  **Start Scheduling:** Let's use a simple interactive tool to help **break down a high-level task** into detailed, resource-allocated sub-tasks.


That's great! It sounds like you're very happy with the foundational documentation we've built.

To keep this momentum going and ensure your project stays on track, let's focus on **control and reporting**. The logical next step is to define how you'll track success and manage inevitable changes.

I recommend we move forward with the following high-impact task:

### Develop a Change Request Form and Process

We can create a robust, standardized **Change Request Form (CRF)** and define the formal process for submitting, reviewing, and approving changes. This is absolutely critical for maintaining scope control in any formalized methodology (Waterfall, PRINCE2).

Would you like to generate an interactive **Change Request Form** template now? This form will include fields for impact analysis (cost, schedule, risk) before any change is approved.


That's an excellent choice. A formal **Change Request Form (CRF)** is the bedrock of project control. It ensures that every deviation from the baseline is documented, analyzed for impact, and formally approved. This prevents the dreaded "scope creep."

I've created an interactive **Change Request Form** that guides the requester through the essential steps of impact analysis (schedule, cost, and risk), ensuring your Change Control Board (CCB) has all the data needed for a rapid and informed decision.

Here is the interactive application:

This form provides a structured process:

1.  **Request:** Fill in the title, description, and consequences of not approving the change.
2.  **Analysis:** The Project Manager scores the change based on **Schedule, Cost, and Risk Impact** (1-5 scale). The overall score is calculated automatically to signal immediate severity.
3.  **Mitigation:** Outline how the team will handle the inevitable impacts.
4.  **Decision:** Space is provided for the **Change Control Board (CCB)** to record their decision and rationale.

You can now use this tool to create formal change requests and print them for signature. What task should we conquer next?
